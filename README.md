I dove into the world of Flutter to create an interactive solar system exploration app. 
Here's a quick rundown:

## 📱 What it does:
- Allows users to explore our solar system through an engaging UI
- Features detailed information about each planet
- Includes 3D models of celestial bodies for an immersive experience

## 🛠️ Tech stack:
- Flutter for cross-platform development
- Dart programming language
- 3D model viewing capabilities

## 💡 Key learnings:
- Implementing a horizontal slider for planet selection
- Creating custom card layouts for each celestial body
- Integrating 3D model viewers into a Flutter app

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges faced:
- Optimizing performance with multiple 3D models
- Designing an intuitive UI for complex astronomical data
- Balancing visual appeal with informational content

## 👨‍💻 What's next:
I'm planning to expand the app with more interactive features and possibly integrate real-time space data. Stay tuned!
This project reinforced my passion for mobile development and astronomy. It's amazing how technology can bring the wonders of space right to our fingertips!
