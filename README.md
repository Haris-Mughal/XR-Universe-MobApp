# CosmoLearn AR App

Over the weekend, I dove into the world of Flutter to create an interactive solar system exploration app. Here's a quick rundown:
📱 What it does:
Allows users to explore our solar system through an engaging UI
Features detailed information about each planet
Includes 3D models of celestial bodies for an immersive experience
🛠️ Tech stack:
Flutter for cross-platform development
Dart programming language
3D model viewing capabilities
💡 Key learnings:
1.Implementing a horizontal slider for planet selection
2. Creating custom card layouts for each celestial body
3. Integrating 3D model viewers into a Flutter app
🧗‍♂️ Challenges faced:
Optimizing performance with multiple 3D models
Designing an intuitive UI for complex astronomical data
Balancing visual appeal with informational content
👨‍💻 What's next:
I'm planning to expand the app with more interactive features and possibly integrate real-time space data. Stay tuned!
This project reinforced my passion for mobile development and astronomy. It's amazing how technology can bring the wonders of space right to our fingertips!
